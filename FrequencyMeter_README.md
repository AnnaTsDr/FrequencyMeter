# Frequency Meter

This project demonstrates a frequency meter developed using C for real-time signal processing.

## Features
- Real-time measurement and display of signal frequencies.
- User-friendly LCD interface for visualizing results.
- Optimized for microcontrollers (8051 series).

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C compiler compatible with the 8051 microcontroller family.
2. Upload the binary to the microcontroller.
3. Connect the required hardware (LCD, buttons, etc.) according to the schematic.
4. Test the system by providing an input signal.

## Technologies
- Language: C
- Platform: 8051 Microcontroller
